		<h2>If</h2>
		<section>
			<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can keep your head when all about you<br>
			&nbsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
			&nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
			&nbsp;Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
			Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
			&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
			&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can meet with triumph and disaster<br>
			&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
			&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
			Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>
			&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
			&nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
			And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
			&nbsp;And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
			&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
			And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
			&nbsp;Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
			&nbsp;Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
			&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">If</Span> you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
			With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—<br>
			&nbsp;Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
			And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!<br>
			</p>

		<h2>The Artificial Infinite</h2>

			like a room with an open window, we<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were haunted:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither exit nor entrance,<br>
			fully: so the ghosts crossed our thresholds:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have all gone out, they have all gone in:<br>
			the little houses leaning into the field of grass, the water<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tower levitating into the sky, the roadside drill<br>
			that digs in the grit:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shock of the human<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine<br>
			continuously beating but irregularly: so absence<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fills with expectation, overfills: and the thing is<br>
			king:
